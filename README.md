# EspressoIn Tools

[EspressoIn Tools](https://espresoin-tools.streamlit.app/) is a Python-based web application built using Streamlit, designed to visualise band structures of materials. The application allows users to upload band structure data in a format compatible with the Quantum ESPRESSO output file (.dat.gnu), calculate the band gap, and customise the plot appearance.

## Features
- Load Band Structure Data: Upload your band structure data in .dat or .gnu format.
- Band Gap Calculation: Calculate the band gap, which is the energy difference between the highest occupied energy level (valence band) and the lowest unoccupied energy level (conduction band).
- High-Symmetry Point Markers: Specify high-symmetry points on the band structure plot and label them with custom or predefined symbols (e.g., Î“, M, R, X, K, etc.).
- Customisation Options: Customise plot appearance, including choosing plot colours, line thickness, marker size, etc.
- Download Band Structure Plot: Download the generated band structure plot as an image in different formats (jpg, png, tiff, svg) with adjustable DPI (dots per inch).
- Multilingual Support: EspressoIn Tools supports multiple languages, including English, German, and Bahasa Indonesia, using JSON files for text localisation.
